# Welcome to Memeito

This is a implementation of "Node.js Meme Scraper" for downloading 10 Meme images using cli (Command Line Interface) from a website.

**Why don't I just use these other projects?**

This project is different from other, it doesn't download the entire webpage, it start scrapping the content while the webpage is still downloading. When we reach our goal of getting the urls of 10 images the http connection is dropped.

**I was writing this script as a task on UpLeveled Bootcamp.**
